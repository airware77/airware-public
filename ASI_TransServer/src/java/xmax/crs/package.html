The xmax.crs package and it's derived packages model the
computer reservation systems (CRS) with which the Transaction Server
interacts; the xmax.crs package provides for a generic description
of such systems, and the specific packages, such as xmax.crs.amadeus,
extend it with the particular idiosyncracies of each of the 
crs systems.

CRS systems are also called Global Distribution Systems (GDS)
and the terms CRS and GDS systems can be used interchangeably.

<p>The Computer Reservation Systems tend to refer to the reservation
system of an airline directly, while the term Global Distribution System
tends to denote middlemen distributors such as Sabre, Amadeus, Apollo, or
Worldspan. As most of the distribution systems are controlled in one way
or another by one or several airlines, the distinction between the two
types of systems is blurring.
