The Airware Transaction Server is a pure java middleware application 
which connects Airware<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> to 
existing Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) and
Global Distribution Systems (GDS) in the airline industry.

One of the main design goals of the ATS is to provide a data interface to 
the Airware application that is "GDS agnostic". It does so by providing an abstraction
layer between Airware and the low level communication protocols of the different GDS systems.

<p>In doing so, it frees Airware application developers from the details 
surrounding the connectivity to the GDS systems, and enables developers to focus
on building functionality that adds value to the data stored in such systems.

<p>The API underlying the Transaction Server aims to mimic the protocols
used by the GDS systems at a low level, so that the different classes that 
make up this API can serve as building blocks for creating more complex
functionality.

<p>Although the Transaction Server was built to connect 
Airware <sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup>, the two products are independent
from each other.  The request interface to the Transaction Server could easily
be extended to support other data interfaces, such as, for example,
an industry standard XML interface.
